# Functionality:

### Color Code to Resistance Calculator 


We've all ran in to those situations where you're in a lab and time is limited but you are stuck going through your lab kit, trying to figure out which resistor is which? 

Fortunately the first function of my app is a Color Code to Resistance Calculator.

Enter the number of bands and color of each band, The app will calculate the resistance and tolerance of the resistor and output it.
